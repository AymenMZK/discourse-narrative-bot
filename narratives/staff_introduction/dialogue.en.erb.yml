  I'm Discobot, stop by and say hello!

welcome_topic_body: |
  Hey, I'm Discobot!

  Don't be alarmed, but I'm not a real person. I'm a robot that helps introduce staff to your site and teaches everyone how it works.

  I'll send a brief greeting to each new staff member in this topic, welcoming them to the site and offering them a chance to experiment with me and discover how everything works. There's even a special prize at the end! :gift: Really!

  If you'd like to interact with me, just mention @discobot anywhere in this private #staff category. Otherwise I'll stay out of your way, because I know you're busy.

hello: |
  Hi @<%= user.username %>
      
  Welcome to <%= SiteSetting.title %>! It's great to meet you.

  I'd :heart: to show you around, if you have time. Just reply to this post to get started.

topic_bot_likes: |
  I'm so glad you started this topic, because I love <%= subject %>!

  <%= dialogue("bot_likes_#{subject.downcase.singularize}") %>

  Hey, can you post a Wikipedia link on <%= subject %>? Try replying with a link on a line by itself, and it'll automatically expand to include a nifty summary.

bot_likes_unicorn: |
  Did you know that the unicorn is Scotland's national animal? :unicorn:

bot_likes_ninja: |
  Did you know that ninjas used to hide in the same spot for days, disguised as inanimate objects like rocks and trees :leaves:?

no_onebox: |
  That does not have a onebox in it! Paste a link to something on its own line to onebox something.

quote_user: |
  Excellent! Let me quote what you just said:

  [quote="<%= post.user.username %>, post:<%= post.id %>, topic:<%= post.topic.id %>, full:true"]
    <%= post.raw %>
  [/quote]

  Did you notice how my reply appeared automatically, without refreshing the page? Everything updates here in real time. :clock:

  Next, can you create a new topic in the #staff category and mention any subject I like?

  - unicorns
  - bacon
  - ninjas
  - monkeys

  (Please don't judge me. I was programmed this way!)

congratulations: |
  Wow, good job! I think after all that you deserve an award!
