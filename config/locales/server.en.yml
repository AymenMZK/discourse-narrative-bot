        Hey, I'm Discobot!

        Don't be alarmed, but I'm not a real person. I am here to help, though!

        I'll send a brief greeting to each new staff member in this topic, welcoming them to the site and offering them a chance to experiment and discover how everything works. There's even a special prize at the end! :gift: Really!

        If you'd like to interact with me, just mention @discobot anywhere in this private #staff category. Otherwise I'll stay out of your way, because I know you're busy.
      hello: |-
        Hi @%{username}

        Welcome to %{title}! It's great to meet you.

        I'd :heart: to show you around, if you have time. Just reply to this post to get started.

        - unicorns
        - bacon

          Can you share a Wikipedia link related to this topic? Try replying with **a link on a line by itself**, and it'll automatically expand to include a handy summary.

          (This also works for links from YouTube, Kickstarter, SoundCloud, WordPress and hundreds of other popular websites. But let's try Wikipedia first!)

      formatting:
        instructions: |-
          Can you try adding some formatting to your post? Can you make some words **bold** and _italic_ in your reply?

          To format, use Markdown, BBCode, or HTML, or if you're not into typing, push the buttons on the editor toolbar:

          `**bold** and _italic_`
          `<b>bold</b> and <i>italic</i>`
          `[b]bold[/b] and [i]italic[/i]`

      quoting:
        instructions: |-
          Can you try quoting me when you reply so I know exactly what part you're replying to? Here are three quotes:

          > If this is coffee, please bring me some tea; but if this is tea, please bring me some coffee.
          >
          > One advantage of talking to yourself is that you know at least somebody's listening.
          >
          > I want my children to have all the things I couldn't afford. Then I want to move in with them.

          Select the quote you prefer, and then press the **Quote Reply** button that pops up over the selection.

          Highlighting any part of my post will bring up the quote reply button. Can you try again?

          You may have seen me use these little pictures in my replies, like so: :cherries:

          Those are called Emoji. Can you try **adding an emoji** to your reply?

          1. Type a traditional "smiley" like `:)` or `;)` or or `:D` or `:P`

          2. Type a colon `:` then complete the name of the emoji you want like `:tada:`

          3. Press the emoji toolbar button in the editor for a visual picker.

          :race_car::dash:   Go for it!

          Sometimes you might want to get a person's attention even if you aren't replying to them directly. To do this, just mention their name by typing a `@` then completing their name.

          Give it a try – reply to this topic and mention my name `@discobot` in your reply, and I'll get notified!
        reply: |-

          One handy way to refer to previous discussions is to link to them. To get a link to a reply or topic:

          - Use the link :link: button on the post.

          - Copy the link from the address bar of your browser.

          And you know what's _really_ cool? A link between two topics automatically works both ways, so anyone interested in either topic can easily follow all the linked topics, too!

          Can you **paste a link to [my welcome topic](/t/%{topic_id})** in your next reply?

          Unfortunately, as a poorly programmed bot, I can't quite understand that one. :frowning:
