          To format, use Markdown, BBCode, or HTML, or if you’re not into typing, push the buttons on the editor toolbar:

          `**bold** and _italic_`
          `<b>bold</b> and <i>italic</i>`
          `[b]bold[/b] and [i]italic[/i]`

          Can you try quoting me when you reply so I know exactly what part you’re replying to? Here are three quotes:

          >
          > One advantage of talking to yourself is that you know at least somebody's listening.
          >
          > I want my children to have all the things I couldn't afford. Then I want to move in with them.

          Highlight the quote you prefer, and then press the **Quote Reply** button that pops up over the selection.

          You may have seen me use these little pictures in my replies, like so: :cherries:

          Those are called Emoji. Can you try **adding an emoji** to your reply?

          1. Type a traditional "smiley" like `:)` or `;)` or or `:D` or `:P`

          2. Type a colon `:` then complete the name of the emoji you want like `:tada:`

          3. Press the emoji toolbar button in the editor for a visual picker.

          Sometimes you might want to get a person’s attention even if you aren’t replying to them directly. Just mention their name by typing a `@` then completing their name.

          One handy way to refer to previous discussions is to link to them. To get a link to a reply or topic:

          - Use the link :link: button on the post.

          - Copy the link from the address bar of your browser.

          And you know what’s _really_ cool? A link between two topics automatically works both ways, so anyone interested in either topic can easily follow all the linked topics, too!

          Can you **paste a link to [the welcome topic](/t/%{slug}/%{topic_id})** in your next reply?

          Unfortunately, as a poorly programmed bot, I can't quite understand that one. :frowning:
